The executive branch is headed by the President of the United States, who also appoints the Cabinet, including the United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.

However, one of the paths mentions Joseph Stalin as a founder of the Red Army, and another path connects the Soviet Union to the office position of General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which Stalin held. Historically, Joseph Stalin is often referred to as a dictator of the Soviet Union, although the term \"dictator\" is not used in official Soviet terminology. The first leader of the Soviet Union, who could be considered a dictator in the context of his absolute power, was Vladimir Lenin, who was the head of the government as the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars from 1917 to 1924. Therefore, the answer to the question, based on historical context and the information provided, would be Vladimir Lenin, although this is not directly stated in the reasoning paths. However, since the question specifically asks for the \"first dictator,\" and the term \"dictator\" is not used officially, the answer based on the paths given would be Joseph Stalin, as he is the only leader mentioned. For accuracy and historical context, Vladimir Lenin should be noted as the first leader with dictatorial powers.",
