However, we can infer that the question is likely asking for a player who was drafted by the Cleveland Browns and has a specific number of passing attempts. The number of passing attempts (108) is not directly connected to any player in the reasoning paths, but we can identify players who were drafted by the Cleveland Browns and then cross-reference with additional information to find the player with 108 passing attempts.\n\nFrom the reasoning paths, we know that Johnny Manziel was drafted by the Cleveland Browns (m.010pvw68 -> sports.sports_league_draft_pick.player -> Johnny Manziel). Johnny Manziel is a quarterback, and the question seems to be asking for a quarterback's passing attempts. However, the reasoning paths do not provide information on passing attempts for any player.\n\nTo answer the question accurately, we would need additional information that is not included in the reasoning paths.

However, the question seems to be asking for the main religion in Eastern Europe that has a sacred site in Jerusalem. Given that the Western Wall and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre are mentioned as being in Jerusalem, and these are significant sites for Judaism and Christianity respectively, we can infer that the question might be referring to Judaism, as the Western Wall is a significant Jewish site.\n\nHowever, the question's structure is confusing because Eastern Europe is not predominantly Jewish, and the main religious sacred site of Judaism is not necessarily located in Jerusalem (though the Western Wall is a significant site). The question might be better phrased to clarify the intended meaning.\n\nAssuming the question is asking for the main religion in Eastern Europe that has a significant sacred site in Jerusalem, the answer would be Judaism, as the Western Wall is a significant Jewish site in Jerusalem. But this does not necessarily reflect the main religion in Eastern Europe, which historically has been predominantly Christian (Orthodox and Catholic).",
